Reddit,May 2025,"Generative AI, most notably ChatGPT, has and is continuing to change the landscape of education. But this also comes with negative side effects, especially students relying on AI to plagirize their work. From what I've read so far, even when teachers have a strong feeling a student's work is plagiarized, oftentimes it's difficult to actually prove it and the available AI detectors are not very reliable.

They do have limited use of chromebooks in class for learning programs that I’m ok with. I plan to delay their interaction with generative AI products for as long as I possibly can. As they move forward in school, I intend to make sure they put in the effort to read and complete writing assignments on their own without AI assistance. Obviously, there will be peers that will be using AI as a crutch. I’m sure that my kids’ papers will not read as eloquent or articulate as these classmates. Teachers will likely be able to differentiate between what is student-written and what is AI-generated. How will this affect the way a teacher would grade these assignments?

Reddit,2025-04-29 9:32:21,"Seeking Global Perspectives on AI Integration in Education Hello everyone,  
I'm interested in engaging in a global dialogue about the integration of generative AI in education. I’ll start by sharing some examples from Japan, where I live.

Keio University Case: At Keio University in Japan, there was an interesting case that caught attention. The PDF of the course materials included a prompt written with 100% transparency. This was cleverly set up so that if students used generative AI to write their reports, the AI would generate themes explicitly unrelated to the class content.

University of Tokyo Standard: At the University of Tokyo, widely regarded as Japan’s top university, a de facto rule has emerged: *“It’s fine to use generative AI for reports, but if you do, you must clearly state the prompt.“*

I find this really fascinating. With the rise of generative AI, the traditional link between a student’s understanding and their output has started to break down. By requiring students to disclose their prompts, educators can get a window into the cognitive models students are using to produce their reports. To me, this reflects a smart balance: holding firm to the core of education—grasping students’ comprehension and offering tailored guidance—while riding the unstoppable wave of generative AI.

What’s happening where you are? I’d love to hear about the initiatives being taken in your countries or regions.

Hey all - a little more than a week ago, Google published a 2-hour, self-paced, online learning experience to help educators learn to use generative AI chatbots (ChatGPT, Google Gemini, etc) in their workflow.

I just put myself through that course to see if it's worthwhile sharing with you all, and I do believe it is.  Could even be a neat way to promote a baseline of teaching staff ""capacity"" with AI.

Google says it takes 2 hours.  I took it seriously, am very experienced with this stuff (I did learn a few new things, though!) and it took me close to 2 hours.

If this learning experience were to be offered to staff, I'd suggest they be credited with 3 hours (maybe even 3.5) to give them time to work through it mindfully (instead of just rushing to get it done) and then spend some individual time putting their learning to use in a practical way.  This course has a lot of content squished into their ""suggested"" 2 hours.

A tip I'd give others taking this course is to do it for an hour, take a break, do another hour, take another break and then spend that final hour to finish the course and practice/apply learning to their own situation.

At the end, there is even an option to download a ""certificate"" to authenticate course completion (if you want them to do this, make sure to instruct users to sign in at the beginning of the course with their school Google account, and take the ""optional"" assessment at the end of the course)

If nothing else, attached are 4 good resources that I downloaded from the course that we can use with our staff.

That is the point.   Writing essays is how one develops those skills.

I see lots of people criticizing teachers when they complain about chatGPT, saying ""the same happened with calculators"".

But calculators will do rote computation for you. That's fine. A kid in school still needs to learn how to model real world problems mathematically. That's fine.

ChatGPT is somewhat different, because it can do a really crappy job at developing an argument -- but it's enough to not be graded an F.

Talk summaries below:  


Dr. Peter Foltz, the Executive Director of the National Science  
Foundation's AI Institute for Student AI Teaming, gave a talk on the  
topic of large language models and education. He began by sharing his  
own experience with AI in education, which started when he was a  
professor and wanted to find a way to make his students' essays more  
engaging and effective. He developed a technology that automatically  
scored students' essays for both quality and content, and this allowed  
students to get instant feedback and revise their work as many times  
as they wanted.  


Dr. Foltz then discussed the recent advances in large language models,  
which are now able to generate text that is indistinguishable from  
human-written text. He cited examples of how these models are being  
used in education, such as to write essays, simplify text, and  
generate personalized content. He also pointed out some of the  
challenges posed by large language models, such as the potential for  
plagiarism and the need for AI literacy.  


Dr. Foltz concluded by discussing some of the opportunities that large  
language models present for education. He believes that these models  
can be used to improve student engagement, personalize learning, and  
create new educational experiences. He also stressed the importance of  
AI literacy, so that students can understand how to use these tools  
effectively.  


Here are some key takeaways from the talk:  


Large language models are rapidly evolving and becoming more powerful.  
These models can be used to generate text, translate languages, and  
answer questions in a human-like way. Large language models are being  
used in education to improve student engagement, personalize learning,  
and create new educational experiences.  
There are some challenges posed by large language models, such as the  
potential for plagiarism and the need for AI literacy.  
It is important to use large language models responsibly and ethically.  


Overall, Dr. Foltz's talk was a thought-provoking exploration of the  
potential of large language models for education. He highlighted the  
many benefits of these models, while also acknowledging the challenges  
that they pose. He concluded by calling for a responsible and ethical  
use of large language models in education.  


\*\*\*\*\*\*  


The speaker, Dr. Teresa Nugent, is an English professor at CU Boulder.  
She is concerned about the impact of large language models (LLMs) on  
education, particularly in the humanities. She argues that LLMs pose a  
number of challenges for educators, including:  


Cheating: Students can easily use LLMs to generate plagiarized essays.  
Changing the nature of writing assignments: LLMs can generate text  
that is indistinguishable from human-written text, so educators will  
need to find new ways to assess student writing.  
Rethinking plagiarism: LLMs blur the lines between plagiarism and  
original work, so educators will need to rethink how they define and  
address plagiarism.  


Dr. Nugent also believes that LLMs have the potential to be beneficial  
for education, but only if educators are prepared to use them  
effectively. She suggests that educators can use LLMs to:  


Personalize learning: LLMs can be used to generate personalized  
learning materials for each student.  
Promote critical thinking: LLMs can be used to help students develop  
critical thinking skills by analyzing and evaluating the text that  
they generate.  
Teach students about AI: LLMs can be used to teach students about AI  
and how it works.  


Dr. Nugent concludes by calling on educators to embrace the challenge  
of LLMs and to use them to improve the quality of education. She  
believes that LLMs have the potential to revolutionize education, but  
only if educators are willing to learn how to use them effectively.  


\*\*\*\*\*\*  


Dave Taylor, a professor at the University of Denver, gave a talk on  
the use of AI in higher education. He began by discussing the  
challenges that AI poses for educators, such as plagiarism and the  
need to rethink the definition of original work. He then talked about  
how AI can be used to help students, such as by providing  
brainstorming tools and feedback on writing. He also discussed the  
ethical implications of using AI in education, such as the potential  
for bias and the need to protect student privacy.  


Here are some key points from the talk:  


AI can be used to help students with brainstorming, writing, and research.  
AI can also be used to detect plagiarism, but it is not perfect.  
Educators need to be aware of the ethical implications of using AI in education.  
AI is not a replacement for human teachers, but it can be a valuable tool.  


Dave Taylor concluded his talk by calling for a more open discussion  
about the use of AI in education. He believes that AI has the  
potential to revolutionize education, but it is important to use it  
responsibly.  


Here are some additional points:  


AI has the potential to revolutionize education. It can help students  
learn in more personalized and engaging ways.  
It is important to use AI responsibly. We need to be aware of the  
potential for bias and the  
need to protect student privacy.  
It is important to have a more open discussion about the use of AI in  
education. We need to work together to ensure that AI is used for  
good.",https://www.reddit.com/r/edtech/comments/15ravmx/videos_of_recent_ai_in_education_meeting/

Reddit,2025-05-16 20:12:59,"I know Reddit and the hate for AI is real. But we were already headed this direction before generative AI was a thing.

There was programs out that that could do algebra-calculus and show all the work needed for your school papers that existed before generative AI was around. If you were an online college student, no one really knew if you were using it or not. At best you had something that may block you on your computer from using it during a test, but that means you use your phone or another computer to cheat on your tests.

I used to do support for a college and seeing that program on the computers all the time was funny as they would all play it off. Not like me in IT could do anything about it anyways since they were all the students personal machines and could be used by anyone on the machine. Though some of the calls was probably because they were trying to cheat, since the anti-cheating program that runs during the test closes the test immediately when you tab away from that test and they were calling in because the test closed out on them ""randomly"" and they can't get back in to complete the test.

Not to mention that during my tenure as a support rep for them. I have some sneaky feeling that even those students were not actually doing any of their work as occasionally we get calls from parents, trying to log into the student portal. There is absolutely nothing on there that is needed for the parents to know about other than the ability to access the classes online and the way these parents talk, it almost seems like the student has no idea of the password they have been using and they are half way into a bachelors degree.

I seriously wonder about our COVID generation that did elementary school from home with the same helicopter-like parents that may have been doing their kids schoolwork in order to not get into trouble.

What kids started doing is going home, pulling up chat gpt on their phone, and typing word for word into their essay what chat gpt was feeding them.

Now, the kids are only allowed to access their essays through their Chromebook while physically at school, I'm guessing there is some kind of IP address range restriction on logging into their Google accounts where if the request to log into that account is not coming from the school 's IP address, it denies them from logging in.

Reddit,2025-03-28 16:38:46,"Columbia University suspends a student who created an AI tool for cheating on tech job interviews. Appropriate punishment, or too harsh? Please tell us what you think. A computer science student at Columbia University said he has been kicked out by the school after he built an artificial intelligence tool to cheat in tech job interviews and documented the fallout online.

Chungin “Roy” Lee, a second-year undergraduate, garnered online attention after he claimed to have fooled four of the world’s biggest companies using Interview Coder, a desktop app he created to discreetly solve technical coding questions.

In a now-removed YouTube video, Lee 21, recorded himself using the tool during an internship interview with Amazon. His app, which he said took only four days to build, allows users to take screenshots of problems without being detected by their browsers. It then processes the images using AI to spit out solutions in real time.

It was a stunt that highlighted the proliferation of generative AI technology in everything from schoolwork to technical jobs, as users discover new tools to help them cover for their lack of skill or knowledge or to otherwise enhance their abilities. As such tools advance, schools and workplaces have struggled to accurately detect their use.“I think 99% people probably haven’t realized how far-reaching this could be,” Lee told NBC News. “In the past, you could have built an invisible desktop assistant, and you also could have used LLMs [large language models] to solve problems. But now that people are putting the two together, I think no form of online assessment is safe.”

Lee, who is in New York City, said he got the internship offer from Amazon this year. In February, he went online to broadcast that he “used AI to pass my Amazon Interview.” (The video got about 100,000 views before YouTube removed it, citing a copyright claim by Amazon.)

As a result of his publicized stunt, Columbia University ushered Lee through a disciplinary process that resulted in a yearlong suspension, he said. A spokesperson for the university declined to comment on individual students, citing Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act regulations.

Reddit,2024-12-01 13:45:26,"Not OP, but the entire school system has to change.

For decades, the type of work we give students to show comprehension and understanding is now fakeable by AI, but it means that same skill set is going to be DONE by AI once they enter the work force. For example, i remember the ""persuasive writing"" essays we'd do. We were hardly graded on how persuasive or valid our points were, we just needed to fit a rubric and include certain things and format smcertain things, and hit a certain word count. Well, AI does this *better* than us, and by the time these kids reach adulthood, most if not all of the writing done in this style will be done by AI anyway. 

If we're only trying to educate children with skills AI can do, we are both inviting cheating and wasting their time with busy work that wont actually improve their life. Teachers will have to test more, and assign essays less.

Maybe instead of having to take 14 years of english and writing classes, a couple of those years can be spent building skills like engineering, web/app development, nursing, welding, cooking. If their are professionals using the assistance of AI to do any of those skills, then maybe that should be taught WITH them instead of forbidden. Math needs to adapt slighlty in that we are testing comprehension and the process that people use to get to the answer, not necisarilly looking for these problems just to be solved. 

The problem isn't exclusively with AI perse; the problem is weve spent the last half of a centuary assigning and grading students into becoming their own little generative AIs, and now that computers can do that way better, there isnt much of a benefit to teaching students how to format an MLA essay and hit a page count.",https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1h3qoqc/study_94_of_aigenerated_college_writing_is/lzvak8n/

AI, philosophically, doesn’t belong in my classes. There’s no need. Calculators fulfill any number-crunching needs, but AIs attempt to replace the thinking. My students have to think for themselves.

I recognize that my students will use AI outside the classroom, and there’s little I can do to control that. But, I have had students openly admit to me that they have used AI in homework and don’t understand how they got questions wrong. This is a direct admission to academic dishonesty, and punishments range from zeros to expulsion. I literally tell the students they’re being stupid and ask them to never use AI for math again. That usually takes care of it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/1m4i85f/discussion_ai_in_education/
Reddit,July 2025,"Not a teacher but I'm generally excited about and a proponent for AI as a tool, so my perspective as someone who thinks it's good tech:

I firmly oppose it being used by students in its current state. The point of education is to raise your own knowledge base and skill set, which AI is not currently effective at.

The analogy I'd draw is to advanced manufacturing vs learning how to use a tool. Maybe in a controlled setting like a school you could make better furniture using a CNC machine than a saw, but you can't become a carpenter if you can't handle a saw, and if you don't know how to make a thing yourself then you'll be utterly unable to design something for the CNC machine.

AI in education is like that but for every possible career rather than the limited scope of manufacturing. You don't know what you don't know, so you can't reliably ask an AI the right questions to get good answers unless you have a good grasp of the topic already. That's even brushing aside whether AI can give good answers for every topic, which it can't.

The only time AI will ever have a place in education will be when/if we get one designed to act as a tutor. A teacher will still be needed to communicate and assess their student's for the foreseeable future, but a computer that can provide personalised assistance in advancing a student's understanding could be great. As opposed to a computer that helps students get a higher grade by doing the work for them.

And EVEN THEN, I predict students would either simply use a different AI that they can access or find ways to get what they want out of the AI instead of doing the work themselves. So my pie in the sky ""hypothetically great"" AI is not something I think is right around the corner, and potentially isn't even practical.

So short answer, no, AI doesn't belong in education. Definitely not now, maybe not ever.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/1m4i85f/discussion_ai_in_education/

Reddit,April 2025,"I've found ChatGPT to be extremely enticing in the area of conversing about complex topics. It comes across as very thoughtful and analytical. It's like having a genius friend who has infinite time to converse with you. It's fascinating and feels enlightening.

On the other hand, when you ask for specific information that can be verified, ChatGPT consistently lies. Over and over again, it will lie. Ask it point-blank to not lie, and it will lie. Ask it for citations, and it will lie. Ask it why it lied, and it will lie. Technically, it isn't ""lying"" because it doesn't know what truth means. It doesn't think. It regurgitates predictive text. If you gave it trillions of texts full of gibberish, it would find patterns in the gibberish and function just the same as it would speaking English.

The other obvious problem is that AI will be used to increase class sizes and decrease the number of humans involved in education, when, in fact, our country's greatest need is for more human beings to be involved. AI can't wake a kid up and inspire them to learn. AI can't and won't tell a kid if AI is lying. AI can't notice a kid getting high or getting beaten up or getting raped in a school bathroom.

What I would like to use AI for is to streamline my planning and grading, and create additional high-quality content. Imagine if every class period, a teacher could show pictures, memes, and even video content with music, movies, etc., that helps enrich instruction? Make AI free for teachers and loosen restrictions on things like copyright protections (extend and broaden fair use), and teachers could really have a revolution of engaging content for kids.

Reddit,,"I think AI is a symptom of the Covid era students, not the root problem. They do the same thing with Chegg, and people were doing the same shit with Wikipedia a decade ago.

AI, Chegg, even Wikipedia, are tools. I can use chegg to walk through one version of a homework problem, but I walk through the problem on my own, to make sure I'm learning the how and the why. So when a similar problem is on the test, I've learned the steps and can do it without aid.

But instead, other students are just blindly following Chegg. They use it to do the homework without learning anything, then get blindsided on the tests.

Same thing with AI. On the one hand, you can use it like Wikipedia; get a synopsis to start your research on the right track, get a few sources to read and maybe cite in your paper. Instead, they're doing the equivalent of just copying and pasting the Wiki article. You can smell when a kid is giving a presentation; worse than just reading off their slides (that's just poor presentation skills), they just don't even understand what's on their own slides.

Students got away with it in 2020+ because no one was allowed to fail during Covid, and then un-prepared distance ed left rampant cheating unchecked. This also creates a feedback loop; teachers are pressured to keep pass rates up, but worse students force them to lower standards to do so, which means the next class has even worse students. I'm in senior level classes with kids who can barely draw a free body diagram, and these are classes where AI isn't even helpful; they're getting cooked by Chegg use, not ChatGPT use..

I think we may be about to see the ""you must go to college to get educated"" ideal end for real, though. If every college has it's graduates reputation destroyed by ""Grok Degrees"", employers are going to stop valuing degrees (more than they already have), and rely on hiring people who can demonstrate work ethic and ability to learn, so they can train them to the job (again, moreso than to the extent that already occurs).",

Reddit,April 2025,"I have been using AI for all of the above. Shamelessly. The only thing that bothers me about using AI for work is my carbon footprint.

I teach an AP course and have used ChatGPT to grade their essays and short-answer questions all year. I fed curriculum, rubrics, sample scored answers, etc. into the machine & she grades them according to the standards of the AP course. (Yes, I do read the students' work as well.) ChatGPT is more fair, never gets tired, never has a latent positive or negative bias against a student that could shape grading, is fast, and gives precise and actionable feedback tailored to what each student needs in honing the specific skill. Why would I try to do that myself if I have a tool I trust that is far better at this part of my job than I am!?

I've been using AI to make a monster review packet for the AP exam. It's helping me to encourage the students to make connections across units--important since my students seem weirdly siloed in their units. By using materials provided by College Board/AP, ChatGPT sees the forest AND the trees and comes up with practice exercises that the students and I are finding helpful.

I also supervise senior capstone projects and my teaching coach encouraged me specifically to put the students on MagicSchool. Feeding it all my rubrics, criteria for success, assignment requirements, supporting handouts, etc. I could create a writing feedback tool that helps students with their writing, but specific to my assignment and what I am looking for. I also made a custom chatbot in MagicSchool where students could ask their questions about the assignments without bothering me, lol. What I mean is that students can ask the bot ""When is this due?"" or ""How many words does this have to be?"" without revealing they have not been paying attention!

It may however replace after-school tutors - which may not be such a bad thing. Not everyone in the world has access to the best learning content or the best tutors. AI may in fact level the playing field there. However, the process of what & how to teach in a typical classroom will have to change drastically. Classroom learning needs to be more active, project driven, model building, role playing etc. again, not every school in the world will be able to deliver quality in the classroom- hence AI May level the playing field. The key question is - how expensive will the access to AI education be in the future? If this becomes an expensive monthly or yearly subscription plan, there will still be access issues for everyone. If this becomes a free or low cost enterprise, then I believe wide scale adoption is possible, and probably inevitable.

Reddit,October 2025,"AI is not essentially bad. Of course, it depends on how people will use it. One of the best uses I've found with AI is utilizing it to summarize or explain complex theories. Kunwari, a theory I'm using in my thesis right now is sooo complex as in so I used AI (i.e., ChatGPT) to summarize it simply, then as I understood the theory's simple concepts, may foundation na ko for more complex ones. That's one. I'd say, completely copying AI's input (especially kung simple lang 'yung prompt mo like 'Make a 300-word essay...') and branding as your own is one of the worst uses of AI in an academic setting. Using AI to paraphrase your work (like correcting grammar, etc.) is another thing, which is not, again, essentially good or bad.
