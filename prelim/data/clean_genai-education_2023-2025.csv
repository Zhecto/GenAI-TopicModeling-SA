They do have limited use of chromebooks in class for learning programs that I`m ok with. I plan to delay their interaction with generative AI products for as long as I possibly can. As they move forward in school, I intend to make sure they put in the effort to read and complete writing assignments on their own without AI assistance. Obviously, there will be peers that will be using AI as a crutch. I`m sure that my kids` papers will not read as eloquent or articulate as these classmates. Teachers will likely be able to differentiate between what is student-written and what is AI-generated. How will this affect the way a teacher would grade these assignments?

I`ll start by sharing some examples from Japan, where I live. Keio University Case: At Keio University in Japan, there was an interesting case that caught attention. The PDF of the course materials included a prompt written with 100% transparency. This was cleverly set up so that if students used generative AI to write their reports, the AI would generate themes explicitly unrelated to the class content. University of Tokyo Standard: At the University of Tokyo, widely regarded as Japan`s top university, a de facto rule has emerged: *""It`s fine to use generative AI for reports, but if you do, you must clearly state the prompt.""* I find this really fascinating. With the rise of generative AI, the traditional link between a student`s understanding and their output has started to break down. By requiring students to disclose their prompts, educators can get a window into the cognitive models students are using to produce their reports. To me, this reflects a smart balance: holding firm to the core of education-grasping students` comprehension and offering tailored guidance-while riding the unstoppable wave of generative AI. What`s happening where you are? I`d love to hear about the initiatives being taken in your countries or regions.

I just put myself through that course to see if it's worthwhile sharing with you all, and I do believe it is. Could even be a neat way to promote a baseline of teaching staff ""capacity"" with AI. Google says it takes 2 hours. I took it seriously, am very experienced with this stuff (I did learn a few new things, though!) and it took me close to 2 hours. If this learning experience were to be offered to staff, I'd suggest they be credited with 3 hours (maybe even 3.5) to give them time to work through it mindfully (instead of just rushing to get it done) and then spend some individual time putting their learning to use in a practical way. This course has a lot of content squished into their ""suggested"" 2 hours. A tip I'd give others taking this course is to do it for an hour, take a break, do another hour, take another break and then spend that final hour to finish the course and practice/apply learning to their own situation. At the end, there is even an option to download a ""certificate"" to authenticate course completion (if you want them to do this, make sure to instruct users to sign in at the beginning of the course with their school Google account, and take the ""optional"" assessment at the end of the course) If nothing else, attached are 4 good resources that I downloaded from the course that we can use with our staff.

I'm sharing the videos of three different professor presentations and talk summaries, in case they are of interest. As you know, the entire education system is in the midst of a huge ""AI reckoning"" with vastly different approaches being tried, ranging from outright district-wide bans on AI use to some teachers requiring students to use AI tools and weaving AI into the syllabus. We learned some interesting perspectives on the current state of AI in education. Full meeting video: [<URL> (2 hrs, 4 min) Video segments for each speaker: Dr. Peter Foltz, Executive Director of the NSF's AI Institute for Student-AI Teaming (iSAT) at University of Colorado, Boulder's talk, ""Large Language Models for Education: Challenges and Opportunities"" [<URL> (25 min) Dr. Teresa Nugent, Associate Teaching Professor of English at the University of Colorado Boulder's talk, ""Artificial Intelligence & Education"" [<URL> (22 min) Dave Taylor, Adjunct Professor & Denver University Leader in Teaching Excellence's talk, ""Generative AI in Education"" [<URL> (20 min) \*\*\*\*\* Talk summaries below: Dr. Peter Foltz, the Executive Director of the National Science Foundation's AI Institute for Student AI Teaming, gave a talk on the topic of large language models and education. He began by sharing his own experience with AI in education, which started when he was a professor and wanted to find a way to make his students' essays more engaging and effective. He developed a technology that automatically scored students' essays for both quality and content, and this allowed students to get instant feedback and revise their work as many times as they wanted. Dr. Foltz then discussed the recent advances in large language models, which are now able to generate text that is indistinguishable from human-written text. He cited examples of how these models are being used in education, such as to write essays, simplify text, and generate personalized content. He also pointed out some of the challenges posed by large language models, such as the potential for plagiarism and the need for AI literacy. Dr. Foltz concluded by discussing some of the opportunities that large language models present for education. He believes that these models can be used to improve student engagement, personalize learning, and create new educational experiences. He also stressed the importance of AI literacy, so that students can understand how to use these tools effectively. Here are some key takeaways from the talk: Large language models are rapidly evolving and becoming more powerful. These models can be used to generate text, translate languages, and answer questions in a human-like way. Large language models are being used in education to improve student engagement, personalize learning, and create new educational experiences. There are some challenges posed by large language models, such as the potential for plagiarism and the need for AI literacy. It is important to use large language models responsibly and ethically. Overall, Dr. Foltz's talk was a thought-provoking exploration of the potential of large language models for education. He highlighted the many benefits of these models, while also acknowledging the challenges that they pose. He concluded by calling for a responsible and ethical use of large language models in education. \*\*\*\*\*\* The speaker, Dr. Teresa Nugent, is an English professor at CU Boulder. She is concerned about the impact of large language models (LLMs) on education, particularly in the humanities. She argues that LLMs pose a number of challenges for educators, including: Cheating: Students can easily use LLMs to generate plagiarized essays. Changing the nature of writing assignments: LLMs can generate text that is indistinguishable from human-written text, so educators will need to find new ways to assess student writing. Rethinking plagiarism: LLMs blur the lines between plagiarism and original work, so educators will need to rethink how they define and address plagiarism. Dr. Nugent also believes that LLMs have the potential to be beneficial for education, but only if educators are prepared to use them effectively. She suggests that educators can use LLMs to: Personalize learning: LLMs can be used to generate personalized learning materials for each student. Promote critical thinking: LLMs can be used to help students develop critical thinking skills by analyzing and evaluating the text that they generate. Teach students about AI: LLMs can be used to teach students about AI and how it works. Dr. Nugent concludes by calling on educators to embrace the challenge of LLMs and to use them to improve the quality of education. She believes that LLMs have the potential to revolutionize education, but only if educators are willing to learn how to use them effectively. \*\*\*\*\*\* Dave Taylor, a professor at the University of Denver, gave a talk on the use of AI in higher education. He began by discussing the challenges that AI poses for educators, such as plagiarism and the need to rethink the definition of original work. He then talked about how AI can be used to help students, such as by providing brainstorming tools and feedback on writing. He also discussed the ethical implications of using AI in education, such as the potential for bias and the need to protect student privacy. Here are some key points from the talk: AI can be used to help students with brainstorming, writing, and research. AI can also be used to detect plagiarism, but it is not perfect. Educators need to be aware of the ethical implications of using AI in education. AI is not a replacement for human teachers, but it can be a valuable tool. Dave Taylor concluded his talk by calling for a more open discussion about the use of AI in education. He believes that AI has the potential to revolutionize education, but it is important to use it responsibly. Here are some additional points: AI has the potential to revolutionize education. It can help students learn in more personalized and engaging ways. It is important to use AI responsibly. We need to be aware of the potential for bias and the need to protect student privacy. It is important to have a more open discussion about the use of AI in education.

There was programs out that that could do algebra-calculus and show all the work needed for your school papers that existed before generative AI was around.

At best you had something that may block you on your computer from using it during a test, but that means you use your phone or another computer to cheat on your tests. I used to do support for a college and seeing that program on the computers all the time was funny as they would all play it off. Not like me in IT could do anything about it anyways since they were all the students personal machines and could be used by anyone on the machine. Though some of the calls was probably because they were trying to cheat, since the anti-cheating program that runs during the test closes the test immediately when you tab away from that test and they were calling in because the test closed out on them ""randomly"" and they can't get back in to complete the test. Not to mention that during my tenure as a support rep for them. I have some sneaky feeling that even those students were not actually doing any of their work as occasionally we get calls from parents, trying to log into the student portal.

Chungin ""Roy"" Lee, a second-year undergraduate, garnered online attention after he claimed to have fooled four of the world`s biggest companies using Interview Coder, a desktop app he created to discreetly solve technical coding questions. In a now-removed YouTube video, Lee 21, recorded himself using the tool during an internship interview with Amazon. His app, which he said took only four days to build, allows users to take screenshots of problems without being detected by their browsers. It then processes the images using AI to spit out solutions in real time. It was a stunt that highlighted the proliferation of generative AI technology in everything from schoolwork to technical jobs, as users discover new tools to help them cover for their lack of skill or knowledge or to otherwise enhance their abilities. As such tools advance, schools and workplaces have struggled to accurately detect their use.""I think 99% people probably haven`t realized how far-reaching this could be,"" Lee told NBC News. ""In the past, you could have built an invisible desktop assistant, and you also could have used LLMs [large language models] to solve problems.

For decades, the type of work we give students to show comprehension and understanding is now fakeable by AI, but it means that same skill set is going to be DONE by AI once they enter the work force.

We were hardly graded on how persuasive or valid our points were, we just needed to fit a rubric and include certain things and format smcertain things, and hit a certain word count. Well, AI does this *better* than us, and by the time these kids reach adulthood, most if not all of the writing done in this style will be done by AI anyway. If we're only trying to educate children with skills AI can do, we are both inviting cheating and wasting their time with busy work that wont actually improve their life.

Reddit,2025-07-01 00:00:00+00:00,"Not a teacher but I'm generally excited about and a proponent for AI as a tool, so my perspective as someone who thinks it's good tech: I firmly oppose it being used by students in its current state. The point of education is to raise your own knowledge base and skill set, which AI is not currently effective at. The analogy I'd draw is to advanced manufacturing vs learning how to use a tool. Maybe in a controlled setting like a school you could make better furniture using a CNC machine than a saw, but you can't become a carpenter if you can't handle a saw, and if you don't know how to make a thing yourself then you'll be utterly unable to design something for the CNC machine. AI in education is like that but for every possible career rather than the limited scope of manufacturing. You don't know what you don't know, so you can't reliably ask an AI the right questions to get good answers unless you have a good grasp of the topic already. That's even brushing aside whether AI can give good answers for every topic, which it can't. The only time AI will ever have a place in education will be when/if we get one designed to act as a tutor. A teacher will still be needed to communicate and assess their student's for the foreseeable future, but a computer that can provide personalised assistance in advancing a student's understanding could be great. As opposed to a computer that helps students get a higher grade by doing the work for them. And EVEN THEN, I predict students would either simply use a different AI that they can access or find ways to get what they want out of the AI instead of doing the work themselves. So my pie in the sky ""hypothetically great"" AI is not something I think is right around the corner, and potentially isn't even practical. So short answer, no, AI doesn't belong in education.

Ask it for citations, and it will lie. Ask it why it lied, and it will lie. Technically, it isn't ""lying"" because it doesn't know what truth means. It doesn't think. It regurgitates predictive text. If you gave it trillions of texts full of gibberish, it would find patterns in the gibberish and function just the same as it would speaking English. The other obvious problem is that AI will be used to increase class sizes and decrease the number of humans involved in education, when, in fact, our country's greatest need is for more human beings to be involved. AI can't wake a kid up and inspire them to learn. AI can't and won't tell a kid if AI is lying. AI can't notice a kid getting high or getting beaten up or getting raped in a school bathroom. What I would like to use AI for is to streamline my planning and grading, and create additional high-quality content. Imagine if every class period, a teacher could show pictures, memes, and even video content with music, movies, etc., that helps enrich instruction?

They do the same thing with Chegg, and people were doing the same shit with Wikipedia a decade ago. AI, Chegg, even Wikipedia, are tools. I can use chegg to walk through one version of a homework problem, but I walk through the problem on my own, to make sure I'm learning the how and the why. So when a similar problem is on the test, I've learned the steps and can do it without aid. But instead, other students are just blindly following Chegg. They use it to do the homework without learning anything, then get blindsided on the tests. Same thing with AI. On the one hand, you can use it like Wikipedia; get a synopsis to start your research on the right track, get a few sources to read and maybe cite in your paper. Instead, they're doing the equivalent of just copying and pasting the Wiki article. You can smell when a kid is giving a presentation; worse than just reading off their slides (that's just poor presentation skills), they just don't even understand what's on their own slides. Students got away with it in 2020+ because no one was allowed to fail during Covid, and then un-prepared distance ed left rampant cheating unchecked. This also creates a feedback loop; teachers are pressured to keep pass rates up, but worse students force them to lower standards to do so, which means the next class has even worse students. I'm in senior level classes with kids who can barely draw a free body diagram, and these are classes where AI isn't even helpful; they're getting cooked by Chegg use, not ChatGPT use.. I think we may be about to see the ""you must go to college to get educated"" ideal end for real, though. If every college has it's graduates reputation destroyed by ""Grok Degrees"", employers are going to stop valuing degrees (more than they already have), and rely on hiring people who can demonstrate work ethic and ability to learn, so they can train them to the job (again, moreso than to the extent that already occurs).",

I fed curriculum, rubrics, sample scored answers, etc. into the machine & she grades them according to the standards of the AP course. (Yes, I do read the students' work as well.) ChatGPT is more fair, never gets tired, never has a latent positive or negative bias against a student that could shape grading, is fast, and gives precise and actionable feedback tailored to what each student needs in honing the specific skill. Why would I try to do that myself if I have a tool I trust that is far better at this part of my job than I am!? I've been using AI to make a monster review packet for the AP exam. It's helping me to encourage the students to make connections across units--important since my students seem weirdly siloed in their units. By using materials provided by College Board/AP, ChatGPT sees the forest AND the trees and comes up with practice exercises that the students and I are finding helpful. I also supervise senior capstone projects and my teaching coach encouraged me specifically to put the students on MagicSchool. Feeding it all my rubrics, criteria for success, assignment requirements, supporting handouts, etc. I could create a writing feedback tool that helps students with their writing, but specific to my assignment and what I am looking for. I also made a custom chatbot in MagicSchool where students could ask their questions about the assignments without bothering me, lol.

AI may in fact level the playing field there. However, the process of what & how to teach in a typical classroom will have to change drastically. Classroom learning needs to be more active, project driven, model building, role playing etc. again, not every school in the world will be able to deliver quality in the classroom- hence AI May level the playing field. The key question is - how expensive will the access to AI education be in the future? If this becomes an expensive monthly or yearly subscription plan, there will still be access issues for everyone.

There needs to be clear rules and social enforcement about what should be human endeavors, how machine use cheapens and devalues those endeavors. That being said... teaching students how to use AI as a tool instead of a shortcut is the more valuable life lesson than just banning it, especially when they ARE going to use it no matter what we do. Think of a math class as kids. Was it really important to learn long division with pencil and paper? If you were doing that math for work as part of accounting or a construction project, it would be irresponsible to rely only on your brain instead of a calculator. What is important is to teach the fundamentals like knowing 1% is 0.01, not 0.1 because without that, when you use the calculator, you end up confidently using it and still getting the wrong answer. In my classes, I treat AI as part of a process: 1)Use AI to find a fact/info. 2)Take steps to verify the fact/source. 3) Make an independent opinion or extrapolation based on that info. My high school teachers blocked Wikipedia on school computers because it made things too easy and the info was not reliable. They should have instead been teaching us to look at the works cited pages from Wikipedia, which are collated and linked to sources for verification. Because we were just googling shit at random or trying to find obscure facts in books and articles with much more opaque signposts about where info was located, the academic rigor of our writings was actually much lower.

Perhaps they still are. Often we would hear how we have to learn the math and how to do it because ""we weren`t going to have a calculator in our pockets"" everywhere we went. Turns out that we do have a handy calculator everywhere we go in our pockets and sometimes on our wrist. Now, as much as I do believe that a calculator is a good tool it is also important to teach the kids the proper way to use it and to teach them to still know how to do simple math in their head. As a math teacher (middle school), I didn`t mind calculators but we did learn how to work out problems without the calculator and later I would teach them how to use it efficiently. Since scientific calculators are different we would work on correct syntax for each type we had in the given classroom. In my opinion, it worked out well and when calculators were not ""appropriate"" for some assignments or tests the students wouldn`t mind. Now, AI may be a similar tool. As teachers we can learn to navigate this new tool in order to teach our students the appropriate time to use it. I do not think AI will be gone ever, it already is in our pockets much sooner than the calculator ever was so we need to either work with it or be doomed by it. It may be intimidating to grasp it perhaps but nothing is impossible to learn if we give it a try. I`m sure teachers who experienced the introduction of computers and the internet in schools had similar feelings as they weren`t used to it but they got through it.

Think of it like this: ai (particular for grammar and writing well) is to writing what a calculator is to maths. Useful to learn without it when you are a child, but in the real world you will very rarely have to go without a tool like a calculator or grammarly. I have a friend doing a phd in astrophysics and winning awards for her work, yet I've never seen her spell astrophysics correctly.

My discouragement of the new technologies is also extended by the fact that AI is relatively new and it is difficult to grasp understanding of, giving the edge to students who have a greater understanding of such technologies even if not relevant to their degree.

universityofliverpool,2023-03-01 00:00:00+00:00,"At present, AI models such as ChatGPT have demonstrated significant potential in enhancing the quality of reports. However, for language courses, schools should impose strict limitations on the use of GPT and employ on-site assessment methods to truly gauge students' mastery of course material. Allowing offline assignments that employ GPT will inevitably lead to unfair situations. For instance, a student who utilizes GPT to improve their report may earn a higher grade without having truly grasped the course content, and their language proficiency may not match their grade. Schools should take measures to prevent such inequities to avoid rendering language courses meaningless. Therefore, adding more on-site assessments can help prevent students from using GPT's polishing function. In contrast, for most engineering assignments, the focus of assessments is on training critical thinking skills. Ddeadline-driven reports are commonly used, which provide opportunities to utilize tools such as GPT. The primary point of contention currently is whether schools allow the use of ChatGPT to complete these reports. From personal experience, GPT is not particularly effective at completing engineering assignments, and it is challenging to rely entirely on GPT for content output. To produce a high-quality report, students still need to learn and assess whether GPT's output is logical, which aligns with the objective of schools teaching courses and students mastering course material. Furthermore, people use GPT due to its powerful resource retrieval function, which provides a summary of the retrieved information. Essentially, this method is similar to using a search engine to find information. The functionality that GPT offers can also be accomplished through internet searches. Before GPT, students already searched for information on the internet, such as Google, when writing reports. Regarding measures to prevent using Google to complete assignments, the current review mechanism is adequate to deal with ChatGPT. In summary, since the current functionality of GPT is limited to searching and summarizing, existing measures are sufficient to mitigate the use of GPT.",https://datacat.liverpool.ac.uk/2297/

universityofliverpool,2023-03-01 00:00:00+00:00,"I also don`t want Chat GPT to ruin coursework for students in the future since you clearly can`t use Chat Gpt in in person exams but you could easily in coursework and etc. It would be really sad to see and I find extensive research in coursework to be really helpful when learning, whereas for exams my main focus is memorisation. If there would be a way to overcome the Chat GPT issue whilst keeping coursework and not having an increase in plagiarism due to the technologies, that would be great.",https://datacat.liverpool.ac.uk/2297/

universityofliverpool,2023-03-01 00:00:00+00:00,I think banning AI technology use by students would be a mistake since this will not prepare students for their future workplaces and will not prevent all students from using the technology. It should be discussed in our degree courses with advice on maintaining academic integrity and using AI as a helpful tool for understanding.,https://datacat.liverpool.ac.uk/2297/

While a student could still use the technology to write an entire essay for example, the work would not be to a standard better than original work, if examined and marked correctly by tutors etc. This could change in time though - they are quickly and constantly improving.
