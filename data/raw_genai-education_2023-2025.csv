Reddit,May 2025,"Generative AI, most notably ChatGPT, has and is continuing to change the landscape of education. But this also comes with negative side effects, especially students relying on AI to plagirize their work. From what I've read so far, even when teachers have a strong feeling a student's work is plagiarized, oftentimes it's difficult to actually prove it and the available AI detectors are not very reliable. Here's the thing: I agree this shouldn't be the route educatiion goes down towards but I do believe that AI has a place in education if used correctly.

They do have limited use of chromebooks in class for learning programs that I’m ok with. I plan to delay their interaction with generative AI products for as long as I possibly can. As they move forward in school, I intend to make sure they put in the effort to read and complete writing assignments on their own without AI assistance. Obviously, there will be peers that will be using AI as a crutch. I’m sure that my kids’ papers will not read as eloquent or articulate as these classmates. Teachers will likely be able to differentiate between what is student-written and what is AI-generated. How will this affect the way a teacher would grade these assignments?

Reddit,2025-04-29 9:32:21,"Seeking Global Perspectives on AI Integration in Education Hello everyone,  
I'm interested in engaging in a global dialogue about the integration of generative AI in education. I’ll start by sharing some examples from Japan, where I live.

Keio University Case: At Keio University in Japan, there was an interesting case that caught attention. The PDF of the course materials included a prompt written with 100% transparency. This was cleverly set up so that if students used generative AI to write their reports, the AI would generate themes explicitly unrelated to the class content.

University of Tokyo Standard: At the University of Tokyo, widely regarded as Japan’s top university, a de facto rule has emerged: *“It’s fine to use generative AI for reports, but if you do, you must clearly state the prompt.“*

I find this really fascinating. With the rise of generative AI, the traditional link between a student’s understanding and their output has started to break down. By requiring students to disclose their prompts, educators can get a window into the cognitive models students are using to produce their reports. To me, this reflects a smart balance: holding firm to the core of education—grasping students’ comprehension and offering tailored guidance—while riding the unstoppable wave of generative AI.

What’s happening where you are? I’d love to hear about the initiatives being taken in your countries or regions.

Hey all - a little more than a week ago, Google published a 2-hour, self-paced, online learning experience to help educators learn to use generative AI chatbots (ChatGPT, Google Gemini, etc) in their workflow.

I just put myself through that course to see if it's worthwhile sharing with you all, and I do believe it is.  Could even be a neat way to promote a baseline of teaching staff ""capacity"" with AI.

Google says it takes 2 hours.  I took it seriously, am very experienced with this stuff (I did learn a few new things, though!) and it took me close to 2 hours.

If this learning experience were to be offered to staff, I'd suggest they be credited with 3 hours (maybe even 3.5) to give them time to work through it mindfully (instead of just rushing to get it done) and then spend some individual time putting their learning to use in a practical way.  This course has a lot of content squished into their ""suggested"" 2 hours.

A tip I'd give others taking this course is to do it for an hour, take a break, do another hour, take another break and then spend that final hour to finish the course and practice/apply learning to their own situation.

At the end, there is even an option to download a ""certificate"" to authenticate course completion (if you want them to do this, make sure to instruct users to sign in at the beginning of the course with their school Google account, and take the ""optional"" assessment at the end of the course)

If nothing else, attached are 4 good resources that I downloaded from the course that we can use with our staff.  If you open only one attachment, the ""AI responsibility checklist"" is slick whether we are talking to teachers or students!",https://www.reddit.com/r/edtech/comments/1gab8d7/experiences_with_the_google_generative_ai_for/ltfecux/

That is the point.   Writing essays is how one develops those skills.

I see lots of people criticizing teachers when they complain about chatGPT, saying ""the same happened with calculators"".

But calculators will do rote computation for you. That's fine. A kid in school still needs to learn how to model real world problems mathematically. That's fine.

ChatGPT is somewhat different, because it can do a really crappy job at developing an argument -- but it's enough to not be graded an F.

Talk summaries below:  


Dr. Peter Foltz, the Executive Director of the National Science  
Foundation's AI Institute for Student AI Teaming, gave a talk on the  
topic of large language models and education. He began by sharing his  
own experience with AI in education, which started when he was a  
professor and wanted to find a way to make his students' essays more  
engaging and effective. He developed a technology that automatically  
scored students' essays for both quality and content, and this allowed  
students to get instant feedback and revise their work as many times  
as they wanted.  


Dr. Foltz then discussed the recent advances in large language models,  
which are now able to generate text that is indistinguishable from  
human-written text. He cited examples of how these models are being  
used in education, such as to write essays, simplify text, and  
generate personalized content. He also pointed out some of the  
challenges posed by large language models, such as the potential for  
plagiarism and the need for AI literacy.  


Dr. Foltz concluded by discussing some of the opportunities that large  
language models present for education. He believes that these models  
can be used to improve student engagement, personalize learning, and  
create new educational experiences. He also stressed the importance of  
AI literacy, so that students can understand how to use these tools  
effectively.  


Here are some key takeaways from the talk:  


Large language models are rapidly evolving and becoming more powerful.  
These models can be used to generate text, translate languages, and  
answer questions in a human-like way. Large language models are being  
used in education to improve student engagement, personalize learning,  
and create new educational experiences.  
There are some challenges posed by large language models, such as the  
potential for plagiarism and the need for AI literacy.  
It is important to use large language models responsibly and ethically.  


Overall, Dr. Foltz's talk was a thought-provoking exploration of the  
potential of large language models for education. He highlighted the  
many benefits of these models, while also acknowledging the challenges  
that they pose. He concluded by calling for a responsible and ethical  
use of large language models in education.  


\*\*\*\*\*\*  


The speaker, Dr. Teresa Nugent, is an English professor at CU Boulder.  
She is concerned about the impact of large language models (LLMs) on  
education, particularly in the humanities. She argues that LLMs pose a  
number of challenges for educators, including:  


Cheating: Students can easily use LLMs to generate plagiarized essays.  
Changing the nature of writing assignments: LLMs can generate text  
that is indistinguishable from human-written text, so educators will  
need to find new ways to assess student writing.  
Rethinking plagiarism: LLMs blur the lines between plagiarism and  
original work, so educators will need to rethink how they define and  
address plagiarism.  


Dr. Nugent also believes that LLMs have the potential to be beneficial  
for education, but only if educators are prepared to use them  
effectively. She suggests that educators can use LLMs to:  


Personalize learning: LLMs can be used to generate personalized  
learning materials for each student.  
Promote critical thinking: LLMs can be used to help students develop  
critical thinking skills by analyzing and evaluating the text that  
they generate.  
Teach students about AI: LLMs can be used to teach students about AI  
and how it works.  


Dr. Nugent concludes by calling on educators to embrace the challenge  
of LLMs and to use them to improve the quality of education. She  
believes that LLMs have the potential to revolutionize education, but  
only if educators are willing to learn how to use them effectively.

Dave Taylor, a professor at the University of Denver, gave a talk on  
the use of AI in higher education. He began by discussing the  
challenges that AI poses for educators, such as plagiarism and the  
need to rethink the definition of original work. He then talked about  
how AI can be used to help students, such as by providing  
brainstorming tools and feedback on writing. He also discussed the  
ethical implications of using AI in education, such as the potential  
for bias and the need to protect student privacy.  


Here are some key points from the talk:  


AI can be used to help students with brainstorming, writing, and research.  
AI can also be used to detect plagiarism, but it is not perfect.  
Educators need to be aware of the ethical implications of using AI in education.  
AI is not a replacement for human teachers, but it can be a valuable tool.  


Dave Taylor concluded his talk by calling for a more open discussion  
about the use of AI in education. He believes that AI has the  
potential to revolutionize education, but it is important to use it  
responsibly.  


Here are some additional points:  


AI has the potential to revolutionize education. It can help students  
learn in more personalized and engaging ways.  
It is important to use AI responsibly. We need to be aware of the  
potential for bias and the  
need to protect student privacy.  
It is important to have a more open discussion about the use of AI in  
education. We need to work together to ensure that AI is used for  
good.",https://www.reddit.com/r/edtech/comments/15ravmx/videos_of_recent_ai_in_education_meeting/

Though some of the calls was probably because they were trying to cheat, since the anti-cheating program that runs during the test closes the test immediately when you tab away from that test and they were calling in because the test closed out on them ""randomly"" and they can't get back in to complete the test.

Not to mention that during my tenure as a support rep for them. I have some sneaky feeling that even those students were not actually doing any of their work as occasionally we get calls from parents, trying to log into the student portal. There is absolutely nothing on there that is needed for the parents to know about other than the ability to access the classes online and the way these parents talk, it almost seems like the student has no idea of the password they have been using and they are half way into a bachelors degree. I already foresaw back then that we may get a generation of kids that are going to be dumb with college degree's because their parents did their work for them instead.

I seriously wonder about our COVID generation that did elementary school from home with the same helicopter-like parents that may have been doing their kids schoolwork in order to not get into trouble.

TLDR: If there is a way to cheat, we all know people are going to do it in one way or another. The dumbing down was going to happen generative AI or not.",https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1ko01kl/its_breathtaking_how_fast_ai_is_screwing_up_the/msonjk7/

That still didn't quite solve the problem so for my wife's subject which is language arts, the kids are only allowed to work in the school on their papers using Google docs which shows all edit history and they have some kind of integrated tool that is still recording all of their keystrokes and mouse clicks. What kids started doing is going home, pulling up chat gpt on their phone, and typing word for word into their essay what chat gpt was feeding them.

Now, the kids are only allowed to access their essays through their Chromebook while physically at school, I'm guessing there is some kind of IP address range restriction on logging into their Google accounts where if the request to log into that account is not coming from the school 's IP address, it denies them from logging in.

Reddit,2025-03-28 16:38:46,"Columbia University suspends a student who created an AI tool for cheating on tech job interviews. Appropriate punishment, or too harsh? Please tell us what you think. A computer science student at Columbia University said he has been kicked out by the school after he built an artificial intelligence tool to cheat in tech job interviews and documented the fallout online.

Chungin “Roy” Lee, a second-year undergraduate, garnered online attention after he claimed to have fooled four of the world’s biggest companies using Interview Coder, a desktop app he created to discreetly solve technical coding questions.

In a now-removed YouTube video, Lee 21, recorded himself using the tool during an internship interview with Amazon. His app, which he said took only four days to build, allows users to take screenshots of problems without being detected by their browsers. It then processes the images using AI to spit out solutions in real time.

It was a stunt that highlighted the proliferation of generative AI technology in everything from schoolwork to technical jobs, as users discover new tools to help them cover for their lack of skill or knowledge or to otherwise enhance their abilities. As such tools advance, schools and workplaces have struggled to accurately detect their use.“I think 99% people probably haven’t realized how far-reaching this could be,” Lee told NBC News. “In the past, you could have built an invisible desktop assistant, and you also could have used LLMs [large language models] to solve problems. But now that people are putting the two together, I think no form of online assessment is safe.”

Lee, who is in New York City, said he got the internship offer from Amazon this year. In February, he went online to broadcast that he “used AI to pass my Amazon Interview.” (The video got about 100,000 views before YouTube removed it, citing a copyright claim by Amazon.)

As a result of his publicized stunt, Columbia University ushered Lee through a disciplinary process that resulted in a yearlong suspension, he said. A spokesperson for the university declined to comment on individual students, citing Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act regulations.

Reddit,2024-12-01 13:45:26,"Not OP, but the entire school system has to change.

For decades, the type of work we give students to show comprehension and understanding is now fakeable by AI, but it means that same skill set is going to be DONE by AI once they enter the work force. For example, i remember the ""persuasive writing"" essays we'd do. We were hardly graded on how persuasive or valid our points were, we just needed to fit a rubric and include certain things and format smcertain things, and hit a certain word count. Well, AI does this *better* than us, and by the time these kids reach adulthood, most if not all of the writing done in this style will be done by AI anyway. 

If we're only trying to educate children with skills AI can do, we are both inviting cheating and wasting their time with busy work that wont actually improve their life. Teachers will have to test more, and assign essays less.

Maybe instead of having to take 14 years of english and writing classes, a couple of those years can be spent building skills like engineering, web/app development, nursing, welding, cooking. If their are professionals using the assistance of AI to do any of those skills, then maybe that should be taught WITH them instead of forbidden. Math needs to adapt slighlty in that we are testing comprehension and the process that people use to get to the answer, not necisarilly looking for these problems just to be solved. 

The problem isn't exclusively with AI perse; the problem is weve spent the last half of a centuary assigning and grading students into becoming their own little generative AIs, and now that computers can do that way better, there isnt much of a benefit to teaching students how to format an MLA essay and hit a page count.",https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1h3qoqc/study_94_of_aigenerated_college_writing_is/lzvak8n/

AI, philosophically, doesn’t belong in my classes. There’s no need. Calculators fulfill any number-crunching needs, but AIs attempt to replace the thinking. My students have to think for themselves.

I recognize that my students will use AI outside the classroom, and there’s little I can do to control that. But, I have had students openly admit to me that they have used AI in homework and don’t understand how they got questions wrong. This is a direct admission to academic dishonesty, and punishments range from zeros to expulsion. I literally tell the students they’re being stupid and ask them to never use AI for math again. That usually takes care of it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/1m4i85f/discussion_ai_in_education/
Reddit,July 2025,"Not a teacher but I'm generally excited about and a proponent for AI as a tool, so my perspective as someone who thinks it's good tech:

I firmly oppose it being used by students in its current state. The point of education is to raise your own knowledge base and skill set, which AI is not currently effective at.

The analogy I'd draw is to advanced manufacturing vs learning how to use a tool. Maybe in a controlled setting like a school you could make better furniture using a CNC machine than a saw, but you can't become a carpenter if you can't handle a saw, and if you don't know how to make a thing yourself then you'll be utterly unable to design something for the CNC machine.

AI in education is like that but for every possible career rather than the limited scope of manufacturing. You don't know what you don't know, so you can't reliably ask an AI the right questions to get good answers unless you have a good grasp of the topic already. That's even brushing aside whether AI can give good answers for every topic, which it can't.

The only time AI will ever have a place in education will be when/if we get one designed to act as a tutor. A teacher will still be needed to communicate and assess their student's for the foreseeable future, but a computer that can provide personalised assistance in advancing a student's understanding could be great. As opposed to a computer that helps students get a higher grade by doing the work for them.

And EVEN THEN, I predict students would either simply use a different AI that they can access or find ways to get what they want out of the AI instead of doing the work themselves. So my pie in the sky ""hypothetically great"" AI is not something I think is right around the corner, and potentially isn't even practical.

So short answer, no, AI doesn't belong in education. Definitely not now, maybe not ever.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/1m4i85f/discussion_ai_in_education/

Reddit,April 2025,"I've found ChatGPT to be extremely enticing in the area of conversing about complex topics. It comes across as very thoughtful and analytical. It's like having a genius friend who has infinite time to converse with you. It's fascinating and feels enlightening.

On the other hand, when you ask for specific information that can be verified, ChatGPT consistently lies. Over and over again, it will lie. Ask it point-blank to not lie, and it will lie. Ask it for citations, and it will lie. Ask it why it lied, and it will lie. Technically, it isn't ""lying"" because it doesn't know what truth means. It doesn't think. It regurgitates predictive text. If you gave it trillions of texts full of gibberish, it would find patterns in the gibberish and function just the same as it would speaking English.

The other obvious problem is that AI will be used to increase class sizes and decrease the number of humans involved in education, when, in fact, our country's greatest need is for more human beings to be involved. AI can't wake a kid up and inspire them to learn. AI can't and won't tell a kid if AI is lying. AI can't notice a kid getting high or getting beaten up or getting raped in a school bathroom.

What I would like to use AI for is to streamline my planning and grading, and create additional high-quality content. Imagine if every class period, a teacher could show pictures, memes, and even video content with music, movies, etc., that helps enrich instruction? Make AI free for teachers and loosen restrictions on things like copyright protections (extend and broaden fair use), and teachers could really have a revolution of engaging content for kids.

Reddit,,"I think AI is a symptom of the Covid era students, not the root problem. They do the same thing with Chegg, and people were doing the same shit with Wikipedia a decade ago.

AI, Chegg, even Wikipedia, are tools. I can use chegg to walk through one version of a homework problem, but I walk through the problem on my own, to make sure I'm learning the how and the why. So when a similar problem is on the test, I've learned the steps and can do it without aid.

But instead, other students are just blindly following Chegg. They use it to do the homework without learning anything, then get blindsided on the tests.

Same thing with AI. On the one hand, you can use it like Wikipedia; get a synopsis to start your research on the right track, get a few sources to read and maybe cite in your paper. Instead, they're doing the equivalent of just copying and pasting the Wiki article. You can smell when a kid is giving a presentation; worse than just reading off their slides (that's just poor presentation skills), they just don't even understand what's on their own slides.

Students got away with it in 2020+ because no one was allowed to fail during Covid, and then un-prepared distance ed left rampant cheating unchecked. This also creates a feedback loop; teachers are pressured to keep pass rates up, but worse students force them to lower standards to do so, which means the next class has even worse students. I'm in senior level classes with kids who can barely draw a free body diagram, and these are classes where AI isn't even helpful; they're getting cooked by Chegg use, not ChatGPT use..

I think we may be about to see the ""you must go to college to get educated"" ideal end for real, though. If every college has it's graduates reputation destroyed by ""Grok Degrees"", employers are going to stop valuing degrees (more than they already have), and rely on hiring people who can demonstrate work ethic and ability to learn, so they can train them to the job (again, moreso than to the extent that already occurs).",

Reddit,April 2025,"I have been using AI for all of the above. Shamelessly. The only thing that bothers me about using AI for work is my carbon footprint.

I teach an AP course and have used ChatGPT to grade their essays and short-answer questions all year. I fed curriculum, rubrics, sample scored answers, etc. into the machine & she grades them according to the standards of the AP course. (Yes, I do read the students' work as well.) ChatGPT is more fair, never gets tired, never has a latent positive or negative bias against a student that could shape grading, is fast, and gives precise and actionable feedback tailored to what each student needs in honing the specific skill. Why would I try to do that myself if I have a tool I trust that is far better at this part of my job than I am!?

I've been using AI to make a monster review packet for the AP exam. It's helping me to encourage the students to make connections across units--important since my students seem weirdly siloed in their units. By using materials provided by College Board/AP, ChatGPT sees the forest AND the trees and comes up with practice exercises that the students and I are finding helpful.

I also supervise senior capstone projects and my teaching coach encouraged me specifically to put the students on MagicSchool. Feeding it all my rubrics, criteria for success, assignment requirements, supporting handouts, etc. I could create a writing feedback tool that helps students with their writing, but specific to my assignment and what I am looking for. I also made a custom chatbot in MagicSchool where students could ask their questions about the assignments without bothering me, lol. What I mean is that students can ask the bot ""When is this due?"" or ""How many words does this have to be?"" without revealing they have not been paying attention!

Reddit,January 2025,"My take is - AI will take over education in a big way, but it will not replace schools, colleges and teachers. It may however replace after-school tutors - which may not be such a bad thing. Not everyone in the world has access to the best learning content or the best tutors. AI may in fact level the playing field there. However, the process of what & how to teach in a typical classroom will have to change drastically. Classroom learning needs to be more active, project driven, model building, role playing etc. again, not every school in the world will be able to deliver quality in the classroom- hence AI May level the playing field. The key question is - how expensive will the access to AI education be in the future? If this becomes an expensive monthly or yearly subscription plan, there will still be access issues for everyone. If this becomes a free or low cost enterprise, then I believe wide scale adoption is possible, and probably inevitable.

Reddit,October 2025,"AI is not essentially bad. Of course, it depends on how people will use it. One of the best uses I've found with AI is utilizing it to summarize or explain complex theories. Kunwari, a theory I'm using in my thesis right now is sooo complex as in so I used AI (i.e., ChatGPT) to summarize it simply, then as I understood the theory's simple concepts, may foundation na ko for more complex ones. That's one. I'd say, completely copying AI's input (especially kung simple lang 'yung prompt mo like 'Make a 300-word essay...') and branding as your own is one of the worst uses of AI in an academic setting. Using AI to paraphrase your work (like correcting grammar, etc.) is another thing, which is not, again, essentially good or bad.

If a teacher is delivering you incorrect resources because of ChatGPT it's equivalent to downloading a lesson plan for a completely different curriculum, they will know what they have to cover and what they have to teach and AI can save a lot of time in structuring a plan to do so. Not inventing teaching material out of thin air. They already know the material, they've learned it, they're teachers, they're just presenting it to you in a certain order in a certain way. Spoiler time: before AI, teachers grab pre-made plans and PowerPoints that other people have made lol, which is a lot less flexible. It's not lazy - I promise you have no idea how many hours of non-teaching admin crap teachers have to do in their own time. Like making PowerPoints and lesson plans for every single class they teach, over and over again. It's like writing lines!

Reddit,September 2025,"My school began using a digital grading system called Smarky, and most of the teachers are pretty thrilled about it. But there are limitiations. In general, what seems to be efficient is grading problems that would've used hiragana, numbers, T/F, English words, and sometimes simple sentences. The answer sheets are scanned through the printer, and it saves time as all scores are calculated and automatically exported to an Excel file. Normally, calculations and inputting grades would all be done one by one. So it does save time.

Some questions are still hand-graded, though. It's the only fair way to assess them. And it does show detailed statistics of question by question accuracy and class comparisons, not to mention instant return of test and results to students digitally.

To be honest, I'm not against such a.i. automation.

For designing lessons, I would esitmate that ChatGPT can do 80% of the work / brainstorming.

Reddit,September 2025,"AI is often the devil, and I often hate it. There needs to be clear rules and social enforcement about what should be human endeavors, how machine use cheapens and devalues those endeavors. That being said... teaching students how to use AI as a tool instead of a shortcut is the more valuable life lesson than just banning it, especially when they ARE going to use it no matter what we do. Think of a math class as kids. Was it really important to learn long division with pencil and paper? If you were doing that math for work as part of accounting or a construction project, it would be irresponsible to rely only on your brain instead of a calculator. What is important is to teach the fundamentals like knowing 1% is 0.01, not 0.1 because without that, when you use the calculator, you end up confidently using it and still getting the wrong answer.

In my classes, I treat AI as part of a process: 1)Use AI to find a fact/info. 2)Take steps to verify the fact/source. 3) Make an independent opinion or extrapolation based on that info.

My high school teachers blocked Wikipedia on school computers because it made things too easy and the info was not reliable. They should have instead been teaching us to look at the works cited pages from Wikipedia, which are collated and linked to sources for verification. Because we were just googling shit at random or trying to find obscure facts in books and articles with much more opaque signposts about where info was located, the academic rigor of our writings was actually much lower.

Reddit,May 2025,"Perhaps this in a way is wishful thinking but I think AI is the new “calculator.” At some point, calculators weren’t always a tool that teachers let students use. Perhaps they still are. Often we would hear how we have to learn the math and how to do it because “we weren’t going to have a calculator in our pockets” everywhere we went. Turns out that we do have a handy calculator everywhere we go in our pockets and sometimes on our wrist. Now, as much as I do believe that a calculator is a good tool it is also important to teach the kids the proper way to use it and to teach them to still know how to do simple math in their head. As a math teacher (middle school), I didn’t mind calculators but we did learn how to work out problems without the calculator and later I would teach them how to use it efficiently. Since scientific calculators are different we would work on correct syntax for each type we had in the given classroom. In my opinion, it worked out well and when calculators were not “appropriate” for some assignments or tests the students wouldn’t mind. Now, AI may be a similar tool. As teachers we can learn to navigate this new tool in order to teach our students the appropriate time to use it. I do not think AI will be gone ever, it already is in our pockets much sooner than the calculator ever was so we need to either work with it or be doomed by it. It may be intimidating to grasp it perhaps but nothing is impossible to learn if we give it a try. I’m sure teachers who experienced the introduction of computers and the internet in schools had similar feelings as they weren’t used to it but they got through it. Maybe I’m just way off but I do think growth happens when you’re the most out of your comfort zone so maybe AI isn’t all too bad.

This is a great way to get students to learn how they can incorporate AI into their working life post-university while getting them to understand the limitations and encouraging them to fact check. A generation of students who know how to use the AI properly and fact check it are far more valuable than students who were not taught this    I use the AI to reword my work to be more formal, or more conversational.    I use the AI to complete all of my menial administrative tasks, non-academic stuff like emails/CVs/submitting research and creating a summary of my work/when the university asks for progress reports - all of this can be done more efficiently with AI     I want to emphasise their use in creating CVs, that's a massive tool than can be tailored to the specific type of CV you need since many are industry specific    I use AIs all the time to generate a paragraph of my research which I can then edit and make my own. For such a long time researchers just splurge everything onto the page and then go back and edit it to make it readable/more accurate/better - AI allows you to skip this first step - it is infinitely easier starting with a paragraph already written and then being able to go back and edit it, than it is to generate it on your own, and using the AI avoids plagiarism     One last thing which I feel is worth mentioning is that people are using chatGPT as a therapist. This is a touchy topic and not my area - but the counselling services could potentially use this as a tool to stop themselves becoming overloaded. You can prompt chat (or Bing) to act as an expert in psychology/CBT techniques and to ask you questions about how you're feeling and give you advice. On the one hand these AIs can express a lot of emotion and have a human touch (particularly Bing), on the other they are not human and they do not judge or get frustrated. The counselling services could work in conjunction with the AIs to produce a sheet of prompts on how to train the AI to do this, I've heard anecdotally that it works quite well, though I understand the sensitivity around this particular point",https://datacat.liverpool.ac.uk/2297/
